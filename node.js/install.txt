Tools for Node.js Native Modules Installation Script 

This script will install Python and the Visual Studio Build Tools, 
necessary to compile Node.js native Modules. Note that Chocolatey and 
required windows updates will also be installed. 

This will require about 3 Gb for free disk space, plus any space necessary
to install windows updates. This will take a while to run. 

Please close all open programs for the duration of the installation. 
If the installation fails, plase ensue Windows is fully updated, reboot 
your computer and try to run this again. This script can be found in 
the start menu under Node.js

You can close this window to stop now. Detailed intructions to install
these tools manually are available at https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#on-windows
