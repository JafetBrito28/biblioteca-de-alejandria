A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely
experiment with changes without affecting the original project. 

Most commonly, forks are used yo either propose change to someone else´s project
to which you do not have write access, or to use someone else´s project as a starting
point for you own idea. You can fork a repository to create a copy of the repository 
and make changes without affecting the upstream repository. 

Propose changes to someone else´s project 

For example, you can forks to propose changes related to fixing a bug. 
Rather than logging an issue for a bug you have found you can: 

Fork the repository
Make the fix
submit a pull request to the project owner.
